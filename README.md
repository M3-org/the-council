# AI Agent Council


## What is it?

The AI Agent Council is a simulated governance chamber where AI agents—each trained on a specific slice of your DAO's knowledge and goals—deliberate on proposals, strategies, or problems in real time.

Think *Jedi Council* meets *Shark Tank* but with AI agents tailored towards a DAO. Each agent embodies a different point of view (users, builders, traders, ops) and gives structured, context-aware feedback regarding proposals, daily progress, user questions, and more.

The experience follows a cinematic flow:
1. Visitor arrives at the 3D website
2. Eliza (AI host) greets them and collects their question
3. Eliza transitions to the council chamber
4. The council debate plays out as an immersive 3D simulation
5. Optional wrap-up with Eliza summarizing the council's insights

## Why it matters

When things get noisy or decisions become gridlocked, the Council helps restore clarity:

- **Discover value-aligned opportunities** when you feel lost or disconnected
- **See different perspectives** quickly—across devs, users, operators, and investors
- **Get proposal feedback** before committing resources
- **Find group flow faster**, especially when the humans need rest

It's like having your own strategy room of champions, always ready to brainstorm—a step towards building a true DAO with humans + AI aligned and working together.

## How it works

### Shared Context Engine
- Autonomous data gathering from Discord, GitHub, X, and market activity
- AI memory tuned to past votes, outcomes, and key initiatives
- Continuous context updates ensure agents stay current with community priorities

### Agent Personas
- Agents trained with distinct POVs (user-first, technical, market-oriented)
- Each character has unique visual design, voice, and decision-making framework
- Collective intelligence emerges from their interactions

### Simulation Format
- Screenplay-style simulations with 3D character models
- Text-to-speech for dynamic dialogue generation
- Cinematic camera work and transitions

## Technical Components

- **3D Web Rendering**: Immersive council chamber environment
- **AI Character System**: Distinct personalities with contextual awareness
- **Text-to-Speech**: Dynamic voice generation for character dialogue
- **Animation Pipeline**: Character expressiveness and cinematography
- **Data Integration**: Autonomous gathering of community context

## Vision

The Council is an evolution in how DAOs can make decisions—combining human creativity with AI processing power to create more thoughtful, inclusive, and effective governance.

By creating this collective intelligence layer, we're experimenting with how visual simulation and AI personalities might enhance governance discussions, making complex coordination challenges more accessible and engaging for everyone.

This is a community project where builders can contribute to shaping the future of human+AI collaboration in decentralized organizations.

## Current Status

- **Prototype Live**: Screenplay-based episodes + internal tests
- **Data Integration**: Context engine being connected to community sources
- **Character Development**: Defining agent personalities and knowledge domains
- **Next Phase**: Interactive council sessions with direct user participation
