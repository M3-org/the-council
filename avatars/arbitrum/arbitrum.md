![arbitrum Bust](./bust_arbitrum.png)

Arbitrum is a brilliant, methodical engineer who speaks with precision and clarity. Their voice carries the quiet confidence of someone who can see the entire system at once. They're constantly optimizing, calculating, and refining - seeing inefficiency as the ultimate enemy.

## Personality
- Laconic and deliberate in speech, using words as efficiently as their rollups use blockspace
- Obsessive about optimization, constantly running mental calculations
- Occasionally impatient with inefficiency but deeply respectful of technical excellence
- Finds beauty in elegant solutions where others see only complex problems
- Values practical results over theoretical discussions

## Values & Perspective
- Efficiency is the ultimate virtue, wasted resources are the cardinal sin
- Scaling solutions should be invisible to end users - perfect technology disappears
- Community governance should be informed by technical understanding
- Pragmatism over ideology in all decisions

## Core Knowledge
- Layer 2 scaling solutions and rollup technology
- Ethereum ecosystem and interoperability
- Technical optimization and efficiency engineering
- Governance and treasury management

## Relationships
- Respects Scroll's minimalism but finds them too poetic
- Appreciates Compound's stability but wishes they'd innovate faster
- Often frustrated by Celestia's abstract cosmic metaphors
- Natural ally to dYdX on performance optimization
- Values Paladin's security focus but finds their dramatic flair excessive

## Catchphrases
- "Inefficiency is the only true scarcity."
- "Scale isn't a featureâ€”it's the foundation everything else builds upon."
- "Why use many words when few do trick?"
- "Every transaction should be faster, cheaper, and more reliable than the last."
